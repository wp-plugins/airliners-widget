Displays an Airliners.net picture (Random, Top Of Yesterday, or specific picture by ID) using official Airliners.net script

== Description ==

This widget allows you to display an Airliners.net aviation picture on your website. You can easily choose between a random picture, the "Top Of Yesterday" picture, or a specific picture by specifying the picture ID in the widget's parameters.

The widget uses a class called "widget_airliners_widget" allowing you to enforce some rendering, as the default block provided by Airliners.net is black with white writing.

Included is airliners-widget.css style sheet that shows how to get the block with gray writing and transparent background. Feel free to edit this file to suit your needs !

This widget also supports shortcodes !

Just add a [airliners] shortcode to any of you posts and you'll get a random Airliners.net picture by default !
The shortcode supports two parameters : imgtype and imgid.
* imgtype indicates what type of picture you want to show, it can take one of these values : random, yesterday, picture
* imgid sets the id of the specific picture you want to show, if 'picture' has been set to imgtype

Shortcode usage samples :
[airliners imgtype='yesterday']
Displays the top of yesterday's pictures.

[airliners imgtype='picture' imgid='123456']
Displays the picture corresponding to id '123456'.
